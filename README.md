# Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-CollabCompet
My solution to Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree 's Project 3 - Collab Compet

## Environment Details



### Solving condition
The mission is episodic. In order to solve the environment, your agent must get an average score of +0.5 (over 100 consecutive episodes, after taking the maximum over both agents).
## Instructions


## Getting Started
To set up your python environment to run the code in this repository, follow the instructions below.


1. please follow the instructions in the python file to set up your Python environment. By following these instructions, you will install PyTorch, the ML-Agents toolkit, and a few more Python packages required to complete the project.
```bash
pip install .
```


2. I use the Windows (64-bit) operating system, [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis_Windows_x86_64.zip) to install the banana game environment. And unzip (or decompress) the file in the folder.
For other operating system, please download the environment from one of the links below.
